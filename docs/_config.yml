  Siranoosh Lazian Tavookjianâ€™s journey from her native Tokat to Fresno,
  California is a remarkable story of survival and the will to persevere.
  The objective of the Turkish government to eliminate the Armenians from
  Asia Minor was accomplished with the utmost cruelty and savagery.
  Siranoosh was one of the few who survived the massacres and fortunate
  enough to arrive in the United States after years of privation and
  struggle.  This story reaffirms the love of an Armenian mother for her
  child and the faith which she had for the Armenian Apostolic Church.
      Narrated in Armenian by Siranoosh Tavookjian
